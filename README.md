I chose two vericals: App Dev and Artificaial intelligence/machine learning.
I am new to both these fields, i chose these verticals because i found their application interesting
and wanted to try it out.

for app Dev:
    I decided to learn native android app development as native app development  is more preferred in major industries,

    and make better apps.     I 

for AI/ML:  
    I learned the basics of python, numpy, matplotlib and panda. Then I started doing Andrew ng's ML course.
    I ran all the codes for numpy on colab and python and panda on kaggle, made some slight adjustments and thden re-ran my code.I got to learn a lot in this process, but I could'nt create a project with this knowledge.
    The subfields that i found interesting were CV and NLP/NLU.
    Out of these two,I wanted to explore computer vision but I couldn’t get enough time, but I am willing to learn about them in the foreseeable future.

I chose two verticals: App Dev and Artificial intelligence/machine learning.
I am new to both these fields; I chose these verticals because I found their application interesting
and wanted to try it out.

for app Dev:
    
   I decided to learn native android app development as native app development is more preferred in major industries,
    but I am willing to learn flutter and cross-platform development in the coming future.
    
   I started learning app dev from devleoper.android.com and made two basic apps along with the course while doing adjustments of my own. Now that I now the basics of android     app development I am willing to work on bigger projects
    and make better apps.     I 
    
   I uploaded the whole project along with the and i have given apk and main code file as well.


for AI/ML:  
    I learned the basics of python, NumPy, matplotlib and panda. Then I started doing Andrew ng's ML course.
    I ran all the codes for NumPy on Colab and python and panda on Kaggle, made some slight adjustments and then re-ran my code. I got to learn a lot in this process, but I        couldn’t create a project with this knowledge.
    The subfields that I found interesting were CV and NLP/NLU.
    Out of these two, I wanted to explore computer vision but I couldn’t get enough time, but I am willing to learn about them in the foreseeable future.
